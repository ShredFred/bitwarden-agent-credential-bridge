# macOS validation and Windows/Cursor handoff

Validated on 2026-08-01 on macOS (`darwin`, Apple host) with Node.js 24.14.1
and npm 11.11.0. Only generated fake credentials and disposable temporary
workspaces were used.

## Outcome

The foreground fake broker demo completes without returning its generated
sentinel. The portable suite now also completes on macOS. Before the fix, five
Phase 5g tests failed because the macOS layout intentionally uses one Application
Support directory as both `config_dir` and `install_root`, while the manifest
contained two exclusive directory-creation actions for that same path.

The manifest builder now:

- emits one exclusive create/rollback pair for the shared macOS directory;
- rejects contradictory observations when the two logical fields describe that
  same physical path differently;
- preserves distinct config/install directory actions on Windows and Linux.

The Windows named-pipe session now performs exact input and request-binding
validation before returning `unsupported_platform`. This keeps its negative
contract tests portable without allowing any Windows process, pipe, or mutation
path to run on macOS.

## Reproduce on macOS

From the repository root:

```bash
node --version
npm test
npm run start:demo
npm run preflight:bootstrap
npm run preflight:onecli
```

Expected results:

- `npm test` passes, with Windows-only live tests reported as skipped.
- `start:demo` returns status `200` and the constant fake API body only.
- `preflight:bootstrap` may report `missing_or_unreadable` until a separately
  approved per-user installation exists. It is read-only and must fail closed.
- `preflight:onecli` may report `aac` as `missing_or_failed`. Do not install,
  pair, or connect a vault merely to make this readiness check green.

The Phase 5g tests create and remove only marker-authorized descendants of the
canonical macOS temporary directory. They do not write to the real home Library,
read Keychain, access Bitwarden, or use network credentials.

## Continue on Windows with Cursor

1. Pull this branch and verify that the worktree is clean before testing.
2. Use Node.js 20 or newer and run `npm test` in a normal, non-elevated shell.
3. Run the Windows-specific slices explicitly:

   ```powershell
   npm run test:phase5c
   npm run test:phase5f
   npm run test:phase5h6
   npm run test:phase5h10
   npm run test:phase5h15
   npm run test:phase5h16
   ```

4. Record the Node, npm, PowerShell, Windows, and .NET versions with the result.
5. Do not install the native service, elevate, pair Bitwarden, pull OneCLI
   images, or use a real secret unless a later phase explicitly authorizes that
   live gate.

Cursor should treat a Windows-only skip on macOS as expected, but any failure in
a pure validator or disposable test as a portability regression. Keep fixes
value-free: errors and evidence must not include paths, SIDs, usernames, raw ACLs,
vault references, command output, or credential material.

## Security boundary retained

This change improves cross-platform correctness; it does not widen authority.
Unsupported platforms and malformed inputs still fail closed. The current macOS
helper code remains a pure evidence evaluator. There is no live XPC/Mach service,
distinct writer identity, Keychain integration, production installer, or real
Bitwarden/OneCLI credential handoff on macOS yet.

The next macOS security milestone should be specified as a separate phase before
implementation: a fixed, code-signed, distinct-principal helper boundary with a
pinned code requirement and value-free audit-token evidence. A same-user helper,
App Sandbox, Hardened Runtime, or a different signing identity alone must not be
treated as the required distinct writer.
